### Me talking about this blog
This blog is a place for me to rant about random interesting stuff in Probability, Machine Learning, and occassional witchcraft a.k.a Deep Learning Applications. The goal is just to provide a simple stance on unfamiliar Math concepts, thus no normal substance would be included in the process. Check back weekly for clickbait update.
